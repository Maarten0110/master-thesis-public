# Welcome
This contains the code to reproduce my master thesis experiments.
This is most easily done through Google CoLab.
You can follow these steps:
1. Install this Chrome extension:
2. Open the file `notebook.ipynb` on GitHub, then open it in CoLab using the extension.
3. In CoLab, choose a GPU with sufficient memory for the runtime environment.
4. Run the first few cells of the notebook *first*. This will mount your Google Drive into the CoLab VM to store the experiment results.
